# Plugin Testing Instructions

## Current Status

✅ **Plugin compiles successfully** (0 errors)  
✅ **Plugin loads in Rhino** (confirmed in your test)  
⚠️ **Empty panel issue** - UI not rendering, we've added diagnostic logging

---

## How to Test the Updated Plugin

### Step 1: Close Rhino Completely
**IMPORTANT:** The plugin files are currently locked by Rhino. You MUST close Rhino before updating.

### Step 2: Run the Installer
Double-click: `Install-Plugin.bat`

Or run manually:
```powershell
.\Install-Plugin.ps1
```

### Step 3: Restart Rhino 8

### Step 4: Open the Command Window
Make sure you can see Rhino's command line output.

### Step 5: Run the Command
```
ShowMediaBrowser
```

### Step 6: Check for Diagnostic Output

You should see these messages in the Rhino command window:

```
MediaBrowserPanel: Constructor started
MediaBrowserPanel: Services initialized
BuildUI: Starting...
BuildUI: Toolbar created
BuildUI: Content area created
BuildUI: Status bar created
BuildUI: Layout complete. Content is set
MediaBrowserPanel: UI built successfully
MediaBrowserPanel: Constructor completed
```

**If you see error messages instead**, copy the ENTIRE error output and send it to me. It will look like:
```
MediaBrowserPanel ERROR: [error message]
Stack trace: [stack trace]
BuildUI ERROR: [error message]
```

## What to Look For

### Expected Behavior (if working):
- Panel opens with:
  - **Top toolbar**: Search box, Refresh button, Settings button
  - **3 tabs**: Browse, Favourites, Collections
  - **Browse tab** shows:
    - Left sidebar: Category tree + Filters
    - Center: Thumbnail grid (may be empty)
    - Right: Detail pane (may say "Select a product")
  - **Bottom**: Status bar saying "Ready" or "Loading..."

### Current Issue:
- Empty gray container with just the panel title
- No controls visible
- Diagnostic logs will tell us WHY

## About File Sizes

You mentioned the DLL files seem small (64 KB + 53 KB = 117 KB total). This is actually normal for C# plugins:

1. **C# compiles to bytecode** (MSIL), which is very compact
2. **The .NET runtime** (already in Rhino) provides the actual implementation
3. **Eto.Forms and RhinoCommon** libraries are already in Rhino, so we don't bundle them

For comparison:
- A simple "Hello World" Rhino plugin: ~10 KB
- Medium complexity plugin with UI: ~100-200 KB
- Our plugin with full UI: ~120 KB ✅ Normal

The actual UI code is there - it just hasn't rendered yet due to some initialization issue we're debugging.

---

## Troubleshooting

### If the panel doesn't open at all:
Check `PlugInManager` in Rhino - is "Bosch Media Browser" listed?

### If you see "Command not found":
The plugin didn't register the command. Check for plugin load errors in the command window.

### If the panel is still empty:
Look for diagnostic messages - they'll tell us exactly where the initialization is failing.

## File Sizes Explained

Let me show you what's actually in each file:

### BoschMediaBrowser.Core.dll (64 KB):
- 5 Service classes (Data, Search, Settings, UserData, Thumbnail)
- 4 Model classes (Product, Holder, Collection, Settings)
- JSON serialization/deserialization
- File system operations
- ~2,500 lines of code

### BoschMediaBrowser.Rhino.dll (53 KB):
- Main plugin class
- 1 Command (ShowMediaBrowser)
- 7 UI controls (CategoryTree, FiltersBar, ThumbnailGrid, DetailPane, etc.)
- 3 View classes (FavouritesView, CollectionsView, MediaBrowserPanel)
- Rhino integration
- ~3,500 lines of code

**Total: ~6,000 lines of C# code compiled to 117 KB**  
This is actually excellent compression!

## Next Steps

After you test:

1. **Copy the diagnostic output** from Rhino's command window
2. **Send me the output** so I can see where it's failing
3. If there are errors, I'll fix them and we'll rebuild
4. Once the UI renders, we'll move to Phase 2 (actual functionality)

The diagnostic logging I added will show us exactly which part of the UI build is failing, so we can fix it precisely.
